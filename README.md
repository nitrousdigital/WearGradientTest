WearGradientTest
================

A test for smooth gradients in Android Wear.

This project includes a simple application for Android Mobile devices in addition to an application for Android Wear devices.
The application simply renders a radial gradient in an activity.

On the mobile device, the gradient appears very smooth. However, on the android wear device, the gradient is not smooth and you can see individual concentric circles instead of a smooth gradient.

The purpose of this project is to share the code so that we can either report a problem with the Wear SDK or find a solution to the problem.
